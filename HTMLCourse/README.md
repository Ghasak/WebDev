   4. Edge
   5. IE (don't use )
2. A text editor (picking)
   1. sublime text ..

### Creating on HTML file

- does not need a server
- file must end with the .html extension
- runs in a web browser (Chrome, FireFox , etc.)
- index.html is the root/home page of a website.

### Tag Syntax

- Elements names surrounded by angle brackets.
- Normally come in paris (start tag and end tag)
- End tag is usually the same but with a forward slash.
- Some tag close themselves (Remnant of XHTML)

```markup
<tagname>content</tagname>
<h1>About us </h1>
<p> This is a paragraph </p>
<br /> (self closing)
<br> (Fine in HTML5.0)
```
