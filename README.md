# Fundamentals
## Contents
This course is for both beginners and seasoned developers that want to learn
how to build responsive websites and user interfaces with modern HTML5 and
CSS3+ technologies like Flexbox and CSS Grid as well as the Sass pre-compiler.
This course includes hours of both learning & studying sections along with real
life projects. Stop having to rely on frameworks like Bootstrap for your user
interface and learn how to create your own layouts and utility classes to build
custom responsive websites and app UIs.
