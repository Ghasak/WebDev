# Guide to ES6 JavaScript
My personal notes on `javascrpit` with `ES6` and the implementation is
exclusive to the vanilla JavaScript.

## Setup the Dev Environment

1. From `npm` use the `live-server` and install it globally using `npm -i -g
live-serer` and check if it existed using `npm -i -g list`

2. Run in the live server using:

```shell
live-server --port=9000
```
3. Open it with `Google Chrome` and inspect the debugger console of `Google
Chrome` with `option + command + j` and check the console.

## Things needed
I am using `nvim 0.6` with `javascript` language server including all the
necessary plugins for developments.
